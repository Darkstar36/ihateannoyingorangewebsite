# ihateannoyingorangewebsite
A little (currently WIP) project that takes ihateannoyingorange.com and makes it more easier to use.

The changes this project makes to the original site includes adding more fruit gore including a few appearances from the Ihateannoyingorange youtube channel along with other fruit gore lovers, so you can expect such classics like "Orange Nya Nya STOMP" and "annoying orange gets skinned alive" added to the fruit gore (because the fruit gore from the original website isn't traumatizing enough). And a "Hall of Annoying Orange Hater Funnies" is planning to be added that contains what I think what the average Annoying Orange Hater will find funny.
