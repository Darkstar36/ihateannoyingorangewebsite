ihateannoyingorangewebsite
A (attempted) decompilation of ihateannoyingorange.com that I made when I got bored. How I pretty much achieved this is that I downloaded every link I was able to get on the website (as a mhtml file) and used a mhtml to html converter for the downloaded links. If you want to modfy the site for yourself, feel free, but credit is needed.

If you don't know what ihateannoyingorange.com is, allow Steven (creator of the ihateannoyingorange.com website) to tell you what this site is all about, "Welcome new users! If you find yourself hating the annoying orange just as much as I do, then you're in luck!! This blog was designed by me to find fellow annoying orange haters :) Please stick around if that sounds like your kind of thing! I hate that fucking orange so much so your support means the world :D"
